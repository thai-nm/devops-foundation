1. Create a named volume called "data_volume" and mount it to a container. Verify that data is persisted even after the container is removed.

2. Mount a directory from your host machine to a container using a bind mount. Modify files from both the host and the container to observe changes.
   
3. Use the docker volume inspect command to view metadata and configuration details of a volume.

4. Identify and remove volumes that are no longer in use to free up storage space.

5. Backup the contents of a volume to your local machine and then restore it to a new volume.

6. Create a container with a tmpfs mount to store temporary data in memory. Observe how the data is lost when the container stops.

7. Write a docker-compose.yml file that defines a service using volumes, then launch multiple containers to share data.

8. Launch a container that uses multiple volumes for different parts of its filesystem.

9. Create two containers, migrate data from one to the other using volumes, and ensure minimal downtime.

10. Launch multiple instances of a container and share data using the same volume between them.
